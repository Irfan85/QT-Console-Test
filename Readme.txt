QT Console Applications 
-----------------------
These projects are created using QT console app project template of QT Creator. That template has an instance
of QCoreApplication in the main method which we have removed to keep everything simple. The core features of
QT can be accessed by just keeping the QCoreApplication header. Creating an object of this is not necessary
for these examples.

New section or new examples start with "***" surrounded comments

Often in the QT6 c++ examples, QT5 codes are used in the examples as of today for some wired reason. As
they are not updated, make sure to search the documentation of the respective classes if something is not
working and look for QT6 ways to accomplish those tasks in the examples.

Some wired QT macros exists for infinite loop, foreach loop etc which are used in the QML book but not in
these projects. Maybe these macros are there for supporting same code in various platforms but it is not really
our concern with these projects.
